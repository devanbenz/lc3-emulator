## LC-3 Emulator (Little Computer 3)

[Little Computer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) is an educational low-level architecture created by Yale Patt & Sanjay Patel. It is used in many electrical engineering courses for students to have a better understanding of ISA and low-level programming. This project attempts to emulate the full LC-3 architecture.

Information about the LC-3:
- 16-bit addressable (2^16 or 65536 unique memory address locations)
- 16-bit wide instructions (first 4-bits for OpCode)
